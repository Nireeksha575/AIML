  Predicting Online Shopper Purchase Intention Using Machine Learning
  We start by cleaning and preparing the data, including encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets. We use a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a visitor will make a purchase based on their behavior during the session. The model is trained and evaluated using accuracy and classification metrics. A sample user profile is also tested to demonstrate the prediction capability.
